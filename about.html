                <p>I’ve been working as a paediatrician since 2021, currently in an paediatrics emergency department. 
                    I have an academic background in computer science and neuroscience. 
                    I tend to develop interest for a multitude of topics, I wish I could each deep dive in.
                </p>

                <p>My main focus these days is medicine, trying on the side to keep old knowledge and skills alive while developing new ones during my free time.<br> 
                    On the long term, I plan to switch focus putting medicine on the side while investing more time in activities I consider more impactful, hopefully. 
                </p>

                <p>This github page aims to present the few coding projects I’ve been working on.</p>
